## üöÄ Ready to Deploy!

### Steps to Push to GitHub:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "ai-research-assistant")
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with README (we have one)

2. **Initialize git and push**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Research Assistant with Clarifying Questions"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Verify deployment**:
   - Check that `.env` file is NOT in the repository
   - Test that someone can clone and run the project
   - Verify all documentation is clear

## üîí Security Reminders

- **NEVER** commit your `.env` file
- **NEVER** share your API keys publicly
- The `.gitignore` file protects your secrets
- Users must set their own API keys

## üìù For Users

Users will need to:
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `env.example` to `.env`
3. Add their OpenAI API key to `.env`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run: `python3 app.py`

## üéâ You're Ready!

Your project is now professionally set up and ready for GitHub deployment!
